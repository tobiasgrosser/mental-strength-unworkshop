However, mistakes are not avoidable, especially for people in the early stage of their career.</p>\n<p>Does excellence equate to doing everything perfectly? Should we avoid doing things that we know we cannot deliver the topmost quality? How big is the room for mistakes in research? We will explore these and some other related questions in the unworkshop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethz.zoom.us/meeting/register/u5YkcemprjwtE9d8mUBF7GdqB24uadufxDQj\">Register here to get the Zoom link for the unworkshop</a></p>\n<h1>About Hung</h1>\n<p>I am a doctoral student in theoretical computer science at ETH Zurich. I also have a business background and worked in the accounting and financial industry before. I am passionate about solving many abstract problems in the realm of mathematics and practical problems in the real world. I value interdisciplinary thinking, where problems are approached from different perspectives and solved by the collective effort by a diverse group of people. In my free time, I enjoy exploring different ideas, expressions, and places.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Perfectionism","date":"2021-06-22 16:00:00 +0100","end":"2021-06-22 17:30:00 +0100","tags":["Unworkshop"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/3832f/perfectionism.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/6c918/perfectionism.jpg 750w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/49438/perfectionism.jpg 1080w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/f4534/perfectionism.jpg 1366w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/3832f/perfectionism.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/2b382/perfectionism.avif 750w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/5688c/perfectionism.avif 1080w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/1c725/perfectionism.avif 1366w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/9641c/perfectionism.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/66907/perfectionism.webp 750w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/27610/perfectionism.webp 1080w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/90004/perfectionism.webp 1366w,\n/static/7fc5c55abe2eb748fb4e91789edf211f/e4c47/perfectionism.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.75}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/21-06-22-perfectionism/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/21-06-18-a-journey-of-discovery-to-your-strengths-and-resources/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A canoeing journey of discovery to your strengths, resources and motivation","tags":["Unworkshop"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/39e1f35b9a7fd1d20775a09ab8782f2a/669f3/canoe-landscape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/39e1f35b9a7fd1d20775a09ab8782f2a/6c918/canoe-landscape.jpg 750w,\n/static/39e1f35b9a7fd1d20775a09ab8782f2a/669f3/canoe-landscape.jpg 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/39e1f35b9a7fd1d20775a09ab8782f2a/66907/canoe-landscape.webp 750w,\n/static/39e1f35b9a7fd1d20775a09ab8782f2a/2d898/canoe-landscape.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.75}}}}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/21-07-07-finding-and-following-your-passion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finding and Following Your Passion -
