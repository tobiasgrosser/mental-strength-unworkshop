**What?**

Learn how to recharge without caffeine, react smarter under pressure and to visualize and act on what you really want.

This workshop series is designed to boost your performance and well-being by teaching you mindfulness based methods that will help you to re-energize, to initiate change and to live intentionally.
Sara Leidinger from artofspark will guide you through three biweekly sessions of well-being essentials. Biweekly, there will be a long 90 minute session and two short 15 minutes sessions. The long session teaches you meditation, yoga nidra and creative visualization. The short sessions called ‘yogic espresso’ and ‘breathing afternoon tea’ teach you how to kick-start your metabolism and how to recharge with small breaks throughout the day.
