The teaching season starts again and it it time to exchange ideas about your
teaching. After some of you already experienced UnWorkshops at the ETH Summer
retreat, join us now for the very first time in person at ETH.

In this unworkshop we explore together our experience in teaching students. We
will discuss the various tricks and tactics each of us uses when we are
teaching and we will practice various techniques that help us to be more
effective and inspiring teachers.

Location: ETH Zurich (details tbd)
Time: tbd
Organizer: Florian Meier
