Learn how to be compassionate in a conflict situation with non-violent communication.

Do you know the feeling that you cannot express what is really happening inside you? Are compassionate listening, honesty and authentic self expression important to you when dealing with people? Then this is the right unworkshop for you. We will take a look at non-violent communication to establish more human connection. For thisÂ  it is essential to express your feelings and needs and to see the ones of the person opposite. There will be some individual reflection and pair discussion on the topic, before we do a role playing exercise, where you can experience different reactions to a situation that was uncomfortable for you.
