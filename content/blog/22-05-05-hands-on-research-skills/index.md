### What?

The publication lifecycle is at the heart of scientific work. It starts with generating and managing ideas, via finding related work, to focusing on specific research questions and finally writing a paper. Paper writing itself is a form of storytelling targeting fellow peers and researchers to communicate your findings and inspire new ideas. In this workshop series, we will guide you through this process in five sessions.
We encourage you to attend the complete series, and to bring your own rough ideas which you will develop into a concrete plan for a paper over the course of the workshops. In particular, we will discuss how to construct a paper based on all its components, how to form a storyline, and how to create a timeline for your writing. To round off the series, we will dedicate a session on critiquing papers and discuss best-practices for science ethics. We are looking forward to combining active discussions with senior researchers, exchange with your peers and hands-on exercises to structure your next paper.
