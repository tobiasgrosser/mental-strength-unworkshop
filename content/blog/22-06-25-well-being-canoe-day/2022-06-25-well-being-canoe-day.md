### What?
You will experience a day on a beautiful river, you’ll learn some canoeing basics and cook and enjoy a delicious outdoor meal together with your colleagues. The questions ‘What gives me energy and what keeps me in the flow?’ will accompany us during the day. You will become more aware about your sources of energy and motivation. You can look forward to fun and deep discussions with your colleagues.
