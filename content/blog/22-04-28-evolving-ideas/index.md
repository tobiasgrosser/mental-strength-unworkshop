You have amazing ideas but struggle to make them shine? Ideas pop up randomly
in your head: you follow them, forget, see them pop up again? Or
do you use a diary, git repo, or org-mode file to store your ideas?  While we
(as scientists) sometimes track ideas conciously, our habits to evolve and
polish ideas are rarely deliberate. Yet, sometimes we experience the perfect
moment: a whiteboard discussion, a blog article, a deep insight while taking a
bath, ... and, suddently, a rough idea turns into a polished insight. Somehow,
we seem to know how to develop exquisite ideas!

In this unworkshop, we will crowd-source best practices of how to evolve
ideas. By playing small and interactive games, we identify the critical steps
that we take when working with ideas. Together, we transform these small
ideas into 'science games', small deliberate activities which we can
experience, practice, and use deliberately whenever we encounter a new rough
idea that may need some polishing.

Join us for an experimental afternoon and play with us the science game.

Your Hosts:
