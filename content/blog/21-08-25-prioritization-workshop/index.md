Long to do lists, more and more tasks you have to take on, and a lot of stakeholders you need to satisfy - that’s an enormous challenge! Prioritisation seems to be a logical step, but what does it mean to prioritize and how can you do that effectively?

The workshop from teampact.ch aims at exactly answering this and giving you a hand to master your to do’s. In the interactive workshop we will: -Analyze which metrics we use for prioritization -Get to know tools for effective prioritization -Understand the differences between planning and reality

We are looking forward to seeing you there. We will help you to tackle your tasks not only in an efficient, but also in a sustainable way. See you soon!.$
