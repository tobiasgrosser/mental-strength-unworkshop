Science is all about generating ideas and executing them!

- Have you ever observed a researcher with a seemingly endless pipeline of
  brilliant ideas? 

- Do you have 10 perfect paper ideas, but struggle to find resources to
  execute them?

- Do you wonder how to contribute meaningfully to 10 papers at the same time,
  if writing one already takes all your time?


You likely already developed your own sophisticated strategies to master these
questions. Maybe you use open-source as a tool to enable collaboration, take
inspiration from improv theater to brainstorm effectively, or take advantage of
teaching and supervision to get in touch with researched-focused
students early on?

In this Unworkshop, we will approach the practical side of idea generation and
as a first step harvest the great strategies already in existence within our
peer group:

- Let's share our connections into the open-source ecosystem!
- Let's share the nuances of the UoE supervision system and explore how we can align
our it with our research interests?
- Let's develop a powerful toolbox of strategies to create and execute our
  personal scientific visions!
