### What?
How can we fuel the motivation of the student? What attitude serves me and the student? What is my supervision style and where does it come from? How to innovate student supervision? We meet outdoors on Zurichberg  in order to reflect on our supervision styles and will address above questions with interactive and experience based methods. Further, you will have the chance to bring your questions and ideas to discuss with your peers.
